Sudoku puzzle solver
====================

### Makers Academy Week 4 task

This task was set whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was to create a model
of a Sudoku puzzle in Ruby and implement an algorithm to solve it using RSpec
for TDD.

Evgeny Shadchev ([@shadchev](http://twitter.com/shadchev)) provided a suitable
algorithm and suggested a way to implement it.

I used this algorithm in my Week 5 task
[Sudoku in Sinatra](https://github.com/jamesjoshuahill/sudoku-sinatra).

This model could be improved by more through unit tests and optimisation of the
algorithm to solve hard puzzles.
