Sudoku puzzle solver
====================

### Makers Academy Week 4 task

This task was set whilst learning to code at
[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com). The aim was a test-driven model
of Sudoku puzzles in Ruby using RSpec with an algorithm to solve them.

Evgeny Shadchev ([@shadchnev](http://twitter.com/shadchnev)) provided a
suitable algorithm and I implemented it.

I used this code in my Week 5 task
[Sudoku in Sinatra](https://github.com/jamesjoshuahill/sudoku-sinatra).

This model could be improved by more thorough unit tests and optimisation of
the algorithm to solve hard puzzles.
